# Contact Form Email Configuration

# IMPORTANT: Resend Free Tier Limitation
# The free tier only allows sending to your verified email address (the one you signed up with).
# To send to other addresses (like hello@fivetwentyfour.studio), you need to verify a domain.
# See: https://resend.com/domains

# For testing (free tier): Use your Resend account email
RESEND_VERIFIED_EMAIL=tangs.email@gmail.com

# For production (after domain verification): Use your business email
CONTACT_EMAIL=hello@fivetwentyfour.studio
